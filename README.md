Spotify Statistics
Most of the personal data that Spotify has about you is accessible through the Spotify app (e.g. playlists, search queries, followers, and streaming history).
You can download a consolidated copy of this data from the Spotify website.
This data will include .csv files with your streaming history, including what you have listened to and when.
This program provides a detailed summary of your listening history in a ranking format.
Included in this folder are five of my .json streaming history files (0-4).
You can substitute these five files for your own five files, ensuring they are given identical names to those given.
Then running the program will give you multiple rankings on your top artists and songs over four different time periods as well as your most recently played music.
The songs/artists are ranked by either play count or play time.
The rankings include the song/artist title, as well as the play count for the song/artist and/or the play time listened in hours.
